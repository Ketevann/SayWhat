# moize CHANGELOG

### 2.3.3
* Remove unneeded iterator key generator method
* Various micro-optimizations

### 2.3.2
* Add `lodash-webpack-plugin` for smaller `dist` builds

### 2.3.1
* Streamline the creation of curriable shortcuts (`moize.maxAge`, `moize.maxSize`)
* Add curriable shortcut for `moize.maxArgs` (missed in initial release)

### 2.3.0
* More options have shortcut methods
  * `maxAge`
    * Curried method (example: `moize.maxAge(5000)(method)`)
  * `maxSize`
    * Curried method (example: `moize.maxSize(5)(method)`)
  * `promise` (shortcut for `isPromise: true`)
  * `serialize`
  * `simple` (shortcut for `maxSize: 1`)
* `moize` functions are now composable (example usage: `moize.compose(moize.react, moize.simple)`)

### 2.2.3
* Simplify internal vs custom cache recognition
* Typing and documentation cleanup

### 2.2.2
* Abstract out `promiseResolver` and `promiseRejecter` into separate testable functions
* Various code cleanups and typing enhancements

### 2.2.1
* Fix issue with `delete` checking `size` of the `Cache` before it had actually updated

### 2.2.0
* Added `promiseLibrary` option to allow use of custom promise implementation
* Bolster `isPromise` logic, auto-removing from cache when the promise is rejected
* Update README for more detailed information on both `isPromise` and `promiseLibrary` options
* Convert `Cache` key iteration to use custom iterator instead of standard loop for more stable iteration

### 2.1.6
* Code cleanup

### 2.1.5
* Fix issue where `delete` would always set the `lastItem` to `undefined` even when items still remained in cache

### 2.1.4
* Move multiple-parameter key matching to cache (allows for custom `cache` to have its own implementation)
* Update documentation for the custom `cache` implementation, as it requires `getMultiParamKey` now, plus give a better example of an alternative `cache`
* Make `keys()` and `values()` methods no-ops when cache implementation is custom
* Make `deleteItemFromCache` method safe with custom `cache` implementations

### 2.1.3
* Enhance `Cache` more for multiple-parameter functions (now benchmarks faster in all categories)

### 2.1.2
* Have `areArraysShallowEqual` use `isEqual` instead of strict equality to allow for `NaN` as key

### 2.1.1
* Optimize cache class to be more efficient in both `has` and `get` operations
* Fix issue with `delete` that was preventing delete of falsy keys

### 2.1.0
* Add `add` method on cache to allow for manual cache insertion

### 2.0.3
* Ensure `maxArgs` is respected for unserialized functions
* Change the arguments length check from `=== 1` to `> ` so that zero arguments (`undefined` key) pulls from cache directly instead of tries to go through key matching for multiparam

### 2.0.2
* Prevent memoization on `moize.react` based on third parameter to functional components (object of all internal react functions)

### 2.0.1
* Fix static types applied to functional components not being applied to memoized component

### 2.0.0
* Refactor to use object equality instead of serialization (vast speed improvements over 1.x.x with multiple parameters)
* Breaking changes:
  * If you were relying on the serialization (using value equality instead of object equality), it will no longer memoize (you can set `serialize: true` if you want to continue using that option)
  * If you were using `moize` to memoize React components, you should change your invocations from `moize` to `moize.react` ([see README](README.md#usage-with-functional-react-components))

### 1.5.0
* Add `values` method on memoized function (gets list of computed values stored in cache)
* Fix issue with `clear` method not being present on `Cache`

### 1.4.5
* Switch to using Cache for caching instead of native Map (was previously only used for polyfilling, but is twice as fast ... I feel silly for not testing its performance prior)
* Simplify and optimize Cache to crank out as much speed as possible

### 1.4.4
* Add `displayName` property to memoized function for better display of memoized `react` components in DevTools
* Throw a `TypeError` when the parameter passed to moize is not a function

### 1.4.3
* Move internal serializer generation to utils, for further partial application leveraging

### 1.4.2
* Leverage partial functions in a number of places (less arguments passed around, improves performance by ~6%)

### 1.4.1
* Correct README error explaining `serializeFunctions` option

### 1.4.0
* Add `serializeFunctions` option

### 1.3.3
* Ensure all numeric parameters (`maxAge`, `maxArgs`, `maxSize`) are a finite positive integer

### 1.3.2
* Replace array-based decycle with Map (performance on circular objects)

### 1.3.1
* Fix README errors

### 1.3.0
* Add keys method to memoized function, to know the size and also get keys for potential deletion
* Update decycle method with modern techniques and helper functions for better circular reference performance

### 1.2.0
* Add `maxArgs` configuration option to limit the number of arguments to use in the key creation for cache

### 1.1.2
* Remove external dependencies in favor of local `Cache` and `decycle` implementation (smaller bundle size)

### 1.1.1
* Make handling of circular handling automatic by stringifying in `try` / `catch`, and remove manual `isCircular` configuration option

### 1.1.0
* Add `cycle` dependency to handle circular objects
* Add `clear` and `delete` methods on the memoized function to allow for direct cache manipulation

### 1.0.3
* Remove warning related to `map-or-similar` dependency consumption

### 1.0.2
* Remove no-longer-needed dependencies

### 1.0.1
* Remove unneeded folders and files from npm package

### 1.0.0
* Initial release
